# Twitter-Sentiment-Prediction-of-US-Airlines

Created a Twitter sentiment prediction model for US airlines utilizing supervised machine learning on a Kaggle dataset of tweets expressing positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, while also implementing data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to address various data issues and error patterns.

Applied seven classification supervised machine learning models and analyzed their accuracy, precision, recall, and f-1 score to determine the best model. 

The top 3 models found are Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (Classifier) and Neural Network with an accuracy of up to 85%.

Provided valuable insights into customer perceptions of US airlines, allowing airlines to make data-driven decisions to improve their services and better meet customer needs.
